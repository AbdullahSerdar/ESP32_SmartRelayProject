# SmartRelayProject
Our project is a system developed with an ESP-based processor that captures sensor data from the environment and controls relays. We aim to create a smart home automation system with unique hardware and software that the user can control remotely via a web interface.

You can find the 4-layer Altium PCB and schematics I created for the project, as well as the embedded software code we developed with the ESP32-S3 processor.
